Program to interface with Google Maps API to support multi modal transit planning using mass transit and biking/walking. It takes a starting location, navigates via biking/walking to the nearest relevant transit stop, then navigates via biking/walking to the end destination. Usually Google Maps transit routes declare routes involving more than trivial amounts of walking unpassable and this remedies that.
